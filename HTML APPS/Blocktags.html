 <p>   Rain, rain, go away
Come again some other day
We want to go outside and play
Come again some other day
Rain, rain, go away
Come again some other day
We want to go outside and play
Come again some other day
Rain, rain, go away
Come again some other day
We want to go outside and play
Come again some other day </p>

    Twinkle twinkle little star.
How I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high.
Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle twinkle little star.
How I wonder what you are.
